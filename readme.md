### 🛠️ Project Description

This project was created **as part of my learning journey** and is intended _strictly for practice purposes_. It is based on the course _Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning 2.0 (2024 Revamp)_ by _Brad Traversy (Udemy)_, but **the implementation is entirely my own**. I used the original project as a reference, but **wrote the code from scratch**, adapting and expanding it to deepen my understanding.

### 🎯 Project Goal

To gain hands-on experience with _HTML, CSS, JavaScript_ and to solidify my knowledge through practice. I also focused on improving my ability to write clean and maintainable code.

### 📌 Disclaimer
